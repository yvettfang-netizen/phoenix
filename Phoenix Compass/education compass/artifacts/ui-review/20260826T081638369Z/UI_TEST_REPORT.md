## Reference-to-product corrections

- Free is 8 required questions and 3–5 minutes, not 4 questions/15 seconds.
- Level 2 uses resolved-bank dynamic counts and 15–20 minutes, not a fixed 40 questions.
- Price is returned by the catalog as 3990 fen/CNY and formatted as ¥39.90; no release page hard-codes the display price.
- Payment remains AFTER_SUBMIT_BEFORE_REPORT; starting Level 2 never creates an order or calls requestPayment.
- Four evidence-status cards replace the five-axis ability radar; scoring remains NONE.
- The flow is Family/Student/Assessment linked and is not described as anonymous.
- Askwise remains RESERVED/BLOCKED/DISABLED with no action or network call.
- Level 3 exposes information/advisor intent only, with no ¥980 price, SKU, order or auto-appointment.
- Native sharing targets only the generic welcome route and carries no IDs, names or result summary.

## Manual completion required

Open the source project in WeChat DevTools, clear Console, compile, and capture all seven normal states plus loading/error/disabled/conflict/payment-state fixtures at 320/360/375/390/430 widths. Repeat safe-area and payment-cancel checks on iOS and Android. Add only actual simulator/device screenshots to `screenshots/`; design-reference crops do not count.
