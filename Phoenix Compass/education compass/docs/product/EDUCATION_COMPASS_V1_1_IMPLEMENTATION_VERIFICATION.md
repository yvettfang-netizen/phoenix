# Phoenix Education Compass V1.1 — Implementation Verification

Verified on 2026-08-27 for the V1.1 question-copy and UI-presentation update.

## Delivered behavior

- Newly created Level 1 assessments use `free_parent_compass_v1.1.0`.
- Newly created Level 2 assessments use `education_growth_discovery_v1.1.0`.
- V1.0 drafts and submissions remain pinned to their original question-bank version and schema digest; they are not silently migrated.
- The V1.1 overlay changes approved question and option wording plus display metadata only. It does not change question IDs, answer codes, required/optional partition, scoring mode, payment timing, or formal-system routing.
- Level 2 remains student-only. EGD17 remains free of budget/income collection. EGD19 remains optional. IB and OTHER remain common-question fallbacks.
- The Mini Program renders backend-provided presentation copy and preserves the route: Free Parent Compass → Family Education Snapshot → student-only ¥39.90 Growth Discovery → submit → optional payment unlock.

## Commands passed

```powershell
npm.cmd run test:client
npm.cmd run typecheck:server
npm.cmd run test:education-contracts
npm.cmd run test:education-http
npm.cmd run test:education-integrations
npm.cmd run validate:education-docs
npm.cmd run smoke:education
npm.cmd run test:server
npm.cmd run build:release
```

`test:server` passed 87 tests. `smoke:education` used the local HTTP mock and made zero external calls. The generated `dist/offline-test` artifact is for local verification only; real WeChat Pay, Feishu Bitable, and OpenAI connections still require their production credentials and deployment configuration.
