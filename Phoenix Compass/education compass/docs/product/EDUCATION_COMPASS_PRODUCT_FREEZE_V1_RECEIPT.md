## Seal validation

- Manifest signature fields are present and contain no pre-signature placeholder.
- All 11 attachment byte counts and SHA-256 values match the raw files named in the Manifest.
- `QUESTION_BANKS_V1_RC1.json` and `TAXONOMY_REGISTRY_V1_RC1.json` parse as JSON.
- The bank contains 48 unique question IDs: 8 Level 1, 19 Level 2 common, and 21 formal-system questions.
- Required/optional partitions are complete; every question has `scored: false`.
- EGD01–EGD18 are required; EGD19 is the sole optional common question.
- `GAOKAO / DSE / IGCSE / A_LEVEL / AP_US` are the only formal question-bank routes; `IB / OTHER` use common-only fallback.
- The five Founder-supplied post-secondary pathways are stored separately under `education_pathway_target_codes`; the field is non-scored, does not route banks, and is excluded from ASKWISE.
