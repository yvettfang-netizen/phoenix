# Family Timeline Event Contract V1

Status: `FOUNDER-APPROVED CONTRACT / APPEND-ONLY EVIDENCE`

## Purpose

Family Timeline is the longitudinal presentation layer for meaningful family events. It is not the Phoenix audit ledger, not a CRM activity dump, and not a place to copy raw assessment answers or sensitive documents.

## Event envelope

## Initial event registry

| Event type | Producer | Minimum consent/policy condition |
|---|---|---|
| `FAMILY_PROFILE_CREATED` | Family OS | authorised family membership |
| `STUDENT_PROFILE_CREATED` | Family OS | verified family/subject relationship |
| `COMPASS_ASSESSMENT_COMPLETED` | Compass handoff | assessment and longitudinal-record purposes |
| `COMPASS_REPORT_AVAILABLE` | Compass handoff | report-delivery authority |
| `JOURNEY_ACTION_DUE` | Family OS journey | authorised journey and date source |
| `ADVISOR_FOLLOW_UP_REQUESTED` | Family OS | exact advisor-follow-up purpose |
| `ADVISOR_CASE_STATUS_CHANGED` | Advisor service | active assignment and family-scoped permission |
| `PARTNER_EXPERIENCE_REQUESTED` | Family OS | separate approved purpose; legacy boolean is insufficient |
| `CONSENT_STATUS_CHANGED` | Phoenix Core | restricted, minimised presentation only |

Future domain events require registry review; they are not accepted as arbitrary strings. `HEALTH_*` events are prohibited until a separate Health gate is authorised.

## Visibility

- `FAMILY`: visible to authorised family members under product rules.
- `SUBJECT`: visible only to the authorised subject and qualifying guardian views.
- `ADVISOR_SHARED`: visible to family and an actively assigned advisor.
- `INTERNAL_RESTRICTED`: operational reference only; not shown to family users.

Visibility is a presentation hint. Server-side RBAC, family assignment, consent, and RLS remain authoritative. `FAMILY` never means every related person automatically receives access. For a minor, `SUBJECT` may include only qualifying guardian views backed by current verified authority. Adult-subject information is not widened to other family members by relationship alone.

## Data minimisation

Allowed timeline content is short, human-readable continuity information. The following must remain outside the timeline payload:

- raw Compass answers;
- passport, HKID, bank, medical, or school-document numbers/binaries;
- full advisor notes;
- authentication tokens, provider subjects, or mapping details;
- internal prompts, agent identities, operations status, or NOVA DIGITAL records;
- approval probabilities, guaranteed outcomes, investment returns, or diagnostic claims.

## Immutability and correction

Accepted events are append-only. A correction creates a new event with `supersedes_event_id`; consumers hide or annotate the older presentation while audit evidence remains intact. Withdrawal immediately prevents new longitudinal, timeline, journey, or advisor processing for the withdrawn purpose. Customer-facing presentation may be hidden or restricted, but withdrawal must not mutate immutable audit evidence or falsely represent that an event never occurred. Exact retention, deletion, anonymisation, DSAR, appeal, and jurisdictional periods remain Legal/Privacy implementation parameters and fail closed until configured.

## Idempotency

The unique logical key is `(source_service, source_record_type, source_record_id, event_type, source_version)`. Exact replay returns the original `event_id`. A changed payload using the same logical key is rejected and reviewed.
